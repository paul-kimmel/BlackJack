*****New Defects
1. While I am drawing cards it is showing the minimum bet but 
seems to be playing the correct bet (fixed; test)

2. Is showing the hint enumeration

*****Old Defects
1. Play sound (done, add more sounds)
2. Can bet below $0 (test some more)
  Can't double if balance would equal 0; should be able to bet to 0
  Make sure we can't split if we don't have enough money
  
3. Speed up initialization - perhaps make shuffle a fast sort or asynchronous
4. Hit space with no game playing causes an unhandled exception 
  (seems to be fixed; refactor so this works in the library as opposed to logic in GUI)

5. Doesn't seem to pay winnings or subtract losses on splits (Done)
Make back of card configurable and animated
Make player hands spread equally across bottom of screen (done)
Keep track of cards dealt, hands played, bets made, and graphic wins and losses
  validate player responses against hints
Three splits: 9, 9, 9 wasn't able to double on the last hand and had plenty of money to do so.(done)
  ***Can't double after split
Verify splits are being played right
Modify it to enable or disable hints
Add a notification to indicate when shuffling
Gave me a double message after more than two cards were dealt
